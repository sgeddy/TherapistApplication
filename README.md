# TherapistApplication
This is a project from ECE 309, Object Oriented Programming, at NCSU. The project is the front and back end of an application that gives random, amusing, therapy responses to questions. First, run the TherapistServer file on the desired host computer and record the server address and port. Then, run the TherapistClient file from any computer that wishes to connect.
